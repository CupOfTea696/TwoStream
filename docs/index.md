# Documentation
<!-- [[TOC]] -->

Welcome to the TwoStream Documentation. Here you'll find any information you need to know on how to install and use TwoStream. Feel like something is missing, or found a typo? Go [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/CupOfTea696/TwoStream/issues) and I'll try my best to update the Documentation as soon as possible. Any bugs you found can be [reported there](https://github.com/CupOfTea696/TwoStream/issues) as well.

Happy Hacking!<br>
